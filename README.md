# radial-integral
radially integrate outward

The inspiration for this code came from two sources. First, I had a version of a radial integral for calculating the power spectral density. However, this code was really slow. I looked online for a faster code and a I foud something here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18102-radial-scan . However, this code cannot handle NaN. I am going to understand this MATLAB code and adapt it for my own purposes. 

The MATLAB code I found was posted by: Narupon Chattrapiban. There is no licence with the File Exchange posting.
